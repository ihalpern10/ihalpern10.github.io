    <h2>Prognosticator, Belichick Disciple</h2>
    <h3> Playoff Picks: 5-1!</h3>
      <p>
        It's been a good showing during the playoffs for this football forecaster, but the one misstep sure did hurt. I'd trade all of my wins to have the Pats back in the Super Bowl, but alas we will have to wait until next season.</p>
    <h3> This Week's Picks</h3>
      <p>The Super Bowl is upon us. While Denver's incredible defense should give Cam and Co. the biggest challenge they've faced during the playoffs, I think the Panthers are going to be too much to handle. I expect Carolina to pull away and cover the 6 point spread as the NFL MVP earns his first Super Bowl ring.</p>

    <h3>Past Picks</h3>
      <h4 id="AFC"> AFC Championship</h4>
        <li>Denver Broncos vs. New England Patriots <span class="label label-danger">Oops!</span> </li>
          <p>
            Brady vs. Manning one last time. It was destined to be this way, wasn't it? What a delight for sports fans everywhere. On one side, we have the healthy-just-in-time Patriots whose offense finally seems to be clicking again. On the other, we have the Broncos who somehow have stumbled their way into hosting this conference championship with the skeleton of Peyton Manning lofting ducks into the secondary. The homefield advantage will make it close, but I pick Bill and Tom to lead New England to a reason-defying 7th Super Bowl in the last 15 years (9th in franchise history).

      <br>
        <h4 id="NFC"> NFC Championship</h4>
         <li>Carolina Panthers vs. Arizona Cardinals <span class="label label-success">Success</span></li>
           <p>Both of these teams had to frantically defend late leads in the divisional round and barely escaped despite seeming to have the game firmly in hand. No matter now as Cam Newton leads his merry bunch of "dabbers" into battle against Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald, the ageless wonder who saved the Cardinals from what might have been the most painful defeat in NFL playoff history-- giving up two Hail Mary's to the Packers in the span of one minute. I expect Carolina's crowd to lift Newton and co. to victory, but it won't be easy against a very impressive Arizona secondary. Look for another close game that comes down to the wire.</p>

      <h4>AFC Divisional</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Denver Broncos vs. Pittsburgh Steelers <span class="label label-success">Success</span></li>
          <p> 
            My pick here is Denver.  While I'm not overly impressed with the Broncos-- perhaps the first #1 seed in history with a bonafide quarterback controversy-- I think the Steelers are too banged up to go into Mile High and come away with the victory. I expect a low scoring affair and I like the Under here.
          </p>
          <li>New England Patriots vs. Kansas City Chiefs <span class="label label-success">Success</span></li>
          <p>
            The Patriots were the NFL's most dominant team during the first half of the season and the Chiefs were the best in the second half. This should be a very competitive game, but assuming that the Patriots have Vollmer and Edelman healthy and ready to go, I expect Belichick to deliver New England to another AFC Championship appearance.
          </p>
        </ul>
      <h4>NFC Divisional</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Carolina Panthers vs. Seattle Seahawks <span class="label label-success">Success</span></li>
            <p>
              What a game this will be! Newton's 15-1 Panthers taking on Wilson's lucky-to-still-be-here Seahawks. I expect we will finally see a game with some scoring and this should be the most entertaining of the weekend. Ultimately though, Carolina has too much offensive firepower. The Panthers will host the NFC Championship.
            </p>
          <li>Arizona Cardinals vs. Green Bay Packers <span class="label label-success">Success</span></li>
            <p>
              The Packers looked great in the Wild Card round, but I suspect a large portion of that had to do with their opponent. It will be a different ballgame in Arizona, where Carson Palmer and the Cardinals await a Packers team that has looked unusually vulnerable this season. I expect the Cards to roll, setting up a 1-2, 1-2 Final Four in the AFC and NFC.
