      <h3 id="summary"> Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Ian was born and raised just outside of Boston, Massachusetts-- now commonly known as Titletown, USA-- where he grew up passionately following the local sports teams. His love for playing sports logically led to fanaticism for the Boston franchises, especially his beloved New England Patriots. His deep NFL expertise is drawn upon on this here page in order to share his picks for the 2016 Divisional Round with the world.

      <h3> Picks</h3>
      <h4 class="conf"> AFC</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Denver Broncos vs. Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
          <p> 
            My pick here is Denver. While I'm not overly impressed with the Broncos-- perhaps the first #1 seed in history with a bonafide quarterback controversy-- I think the Steelers are too banged up to go into Mile High and come away with the victory. I expect a low scoring affair and I like the Under here.
          </p>
        <li>New England Patriots vs. Kansas City Chiefs</li>
          <p>
            The Patriots were the NFL's most dominant team during the first half of the season and the Chiefs were the best in the second half. This should be a very competitive game, but assuming that the Patriots have Vollmer and Edelman healthy and ready to go, I expect Belichick to deliver New England to another AFC Championship appearance.
          </p>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <h4 class="conf"> NFC</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Carolina Panthers vs. Seattle Seahawks</li>
          <p>
            What a game this will be! Newton's 15-1 Panthers taking on Wilson's lucky-to-still-be-here Seahawks. I expect we will finally see a game with some scoring and this should be the most entertaining of the weekend. Ultimately though, Carolina has too much offensive firepower. The Panthers will host the NFC Championship.
          </p>
        <li>Arizona Cardinals vs. Green Bay Packers</li>
          <p>
            The Packers looked great in the Wild Card round, but I suspect a large portion of that had to do with their opponent. It will be a different ballgame in Arizona, where Carson Palmer and the Cardinals await a Packers team that has looked unusually vulnerable this season. I expect the Cards to roll, setting up a 1-2, 1-2 Final Four in the AFC and NFC.
